We know that we have a, a shortage of, of homes and housing, and the cost of housing is too expensive for far too many people. We know that young families need support to raise their children.

My opponent, on the other hand, his plan is to do what he has done before, which is to provide a tax cut for billionaires and big corporations, which will result in $5 trillion to America’s deficit. My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump’s sales tax, which would be a 20% tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month.

Other countries are gonna finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off because it was so much money. They can’t, it would totally destroy everything that they’ve set out to do. They’re taking in billions of dollars from China and other places. They’ve left the tariffs on. When I had it, I had tariffs, and yet I had no inflation. Uh, look, we’ve had a terrible economy because inflation has, which is really known as a country buster. It breaks up countries.

But I’m gonna tell y’all on this debate tonight, you’re gonna hear from the same old, tired playbook, a bunch of lies, grievances, and name calling. What you’re going to hear tonight is a detailed and dangerous plan called Project 2025 that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected to.

Everybody knows I’m an open book. Everybody knows what I’m gonna do. Cut taxes very substantially and create a great economy like I did before. We had the greatest economy. We got hit with a pandemic. And the pandemic was not since 1917 where a hundred million people died. Has there been anything like it? We did a phenomenal with the pandemic. We handed them over a country where the economy and where the stock market was higher than it was before the pandemic came in. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. We made ventilators for the entire world. We got gowns, we got masks. We did things that nobody thought possible. And people give me credit for rebuilding the military. They give me credit for a lot of things, but not enough credit for the great job we did with the pandemic. But the only jobs they got were bounce back jobs.

What Goldman Sachs has said is that Donald Trump’s plan would make the economy worse. Mine would strengthen the economy. What the Wharton School has said is Donald Trump’s plan would actually explode the deficit. 16 Nobel Laureates have described his economic plan as something that would increase inflation and by the middle of next year would invite a recession.

"Mr. President, I do wanna drill down on something you both brought up. Uh, the vice president brought up, uh, your tariffs. You responded, and let’s drill down on this because your plan is what she calls is essentially a national sales tax. Your proposal calls for tariffs, as you pointed out here on foreign imports across the board. You recently said that you might double your plan imposing tariffs up to 20% on goods coming into this country. As you know, many economists say that we tariffs at that level. Costs are then passed on to the consumer Vice President Harris has argued. It’ll mean higher prices on gas, food, clothing, medication, arguing. It costs the typical family nearly $4,000 a year. Do you believe Americans can afford higher prices because of tariffs?","Q-OQ,SEEP",,,,1,,Q-OQ,BQ,policy,,1,,,FALSE,FALSE

I charge, I was the only president ever. China was paying us hundreds of billions of dollars. And so were other countries. And you know, if she doesn’t like them, they should have gone out and they should have immediately cut the tariffs. But those tariffs are there three and a half years now, under their administration, we are gonna take in billions of dollars, hundreds of billions of dollars. I had no inflation. Virtually no inflation. They had the highest inflation perhaps in the history of our country because I’ve never seen a worse period of time. People can’t go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else. These, the people of our country are absolutely dying with what they’ve done. They’ve destroyed the economy.

"Well, let’s be clear that the Trump administration resulted in a trade deficit. One of the highest we’ve ever seen in the history of America. He invited trade wars. You wanna talk about his deal with China. What he ended up doing is under Donald Trump’s presidency, he ended up selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military. Basically sold us out when a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century. Which means focusing on the details of what that requires, focusing on relationships with our allies, focusing on investing in American based technology so that we win the race on ai, on quantum computing, focusing on what we need to do to support America’s workforce so that we don’t end up having the on the short end of the stick in terms of workers rights. But what Donald Trump did, let’s talk about this with COVID, is he actually thanked President Xi for what he did during Covid. Look at his tweet.

In other words, we’ll execute the baby. And that’s why I did that. Because that predominates because they’re radical. The Democrats are radical in that. And her vice presidential pick, which I think is a horrible pick by the way for our country, ’cause he is really out of it.

Now, I believe in the exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother, I believe strongly. And Ronald Reagan did also. 85% of Republicans do exceptions. Very important. But we were able to get it. And now states are voting on it. And for the first time, you’re gonna see, look, this is a, an issue that’s torn our country apart. For 52 years, every legal scholar, every democrat, every republican, liberal conservative, they all wanted this issue to be brought back to the states where the people could vote. And that’s what happened, happened. Now, Ohio, the vote was somewhat liberal. Kansas, the vote was somewhat liberal, much more liberal than people would’ve thought. But each individual state is voting. It’s the vote of the people now. It’s not tied up in the federal government. I did a great service in doing it. It took courage to do it.

Donald Trump hand selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. And they did exactly as he intended. And now in over 20 states, there are Trump abortion bans, which make it criminal for a doctor or nurse to provide healthcare in one state. It provides prison for life. Trump abortion bans that make no exception, even for rape and incest, which understand what that means. A survivor of a crime, a violation to their body, does not have the right to make a decision about what happens to their body next that is immoral. And one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government.

She didn’t want that. Her husband didn’t want that. A 12 or 13-year-old survivor of incest being forced to carry a pregnancy to turn, they don’t want that. And I pledge to you, when Congress passes a bill to put back in place the protections of Roe v. Wade as President of the United States. I will proudly sign it into law. But understand if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.

It includes growing what we can do around American manufacturing and opening up auto plants. Not closing them like happened under Donald Trump.

"That didn’t happen under Donald Trump. Let me just tell you, they lost 10,000 manufacturing jobs this last month. It’s going, they’re all leaving. Uh, they’re building big auto plants in Mexico, in many cases owned by China. They’re building these massive plants and they think they’re gonna sell their cars into the United States because of these people. What they have given to China is unbelievable. But we’re not gonna let that we’ll put tariffs on those cars so they can’t come into our country because they will kill the United Auto Workers. And any auto worker, whether it’s in Detroit or South Carolina or any other place, what they’ve to business and manufacturing in this country is horrible. We have nothing because they, they refuse. You know, Biden doesn’t go after people because supposedly China paid millions of dollars. He’s afraid to do it between him and his son. They get all this money from Ukraine, they get all this money from all of these different countries. And then you wonder why is he so loyal to this one? That one Ukraine, China. Why is he, why did he get three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife? Why did he get, why did she pay him three and a half million dollars? This is a crooked administration and they’re selling our country down the tubes.",CH,,Biden and opponents,,1,,CH,"REB, ATTR, AEX, PER",Biden and opponent group,,1,,,TRUE,FALSE

"So I think you’ve heard tonight, two very different visions for our country. One that is focused on the future and the other that is focused on the past and an attempt to take us backward. But we’re not going back. And I do believe that the American people know we all have so much more in common than what separates us. And we can chart a new way forward. And a vision of that includes having a plan, understanding the aspirations, the dreams, the hopes, the ambition of the American people, which is why I intend to create an opportunity economy. Investing in small businesses, in new families, in what we can do around protecting seniors. What we can do that is about giving hardworking folks a break and bringing down the cost of living. I believe in what we can do together that is about sustaining America, standing in the world and ensuring that we have the respect that we so rightly deserve, including respecting our military and ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world.",S,"PER,REB",,,1,,S,"IP, AE, ATTR",Trump,,1,,,TRUE,FALSE

I’ll tell you, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was the da. I was an attorney general, a United States senator, and now vice president. I’ve only had one client. The people. And I’ll tell you, as a prosecutor, I never asked a victim or a witness, are you a Republican or a Democrat? The only thing I ever ask them, are you okay? And that’s the kind of president we need right now. Someone who cares about you and is not putting themselves first. I intend to be a president for all Americans and focus on what we can do over the next 10 and 20 years to build back up our country by investing right now in you, the American people,",S,AP,,,1,,S,"AP, UF",,,1,,,TRUE,FALSE

Go down to that beautiful white House, go to the capitol, get everyone together and do the things you wanna do. But you haven’t done it. And you won’t do it because you believe in things that the American people don’t believe in. You believe in things like we’re not gonna frack, we’re not gonna take fossil fuel.

"Germany tried that and within one year they were back to building normal energy plants. We’re not ready for it. We can’t sacrifice our country for the sake of bad vision. But I just ask simple question, why didn’t she do it? We’re a failing nation. We’re a nation that’s in serious decline. We’re being laughed at all over the world. All over the world. They’re laughed. I know the leaders very well. They’re coming to see me. They call me. We’re laughed at all over the world. They don’t understand what happened to us as a nation. We’re not a leader. We don’t have any idea what’s going on. We have wars going on in the Middle East. We have wars going on with Russia and Ukraine. We’re gonna end up in a third world war and it’ll be a war like no other because of nuclear weapons. The power of weaponry. I rebuilt our entire military. She gave a lot of it away to the Taliban. She gave it to Afghanistan. What these people have done to our country, and maybe toughest of all, is allowing millions of people to come into our country.
